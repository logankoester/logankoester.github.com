It's not hard, but it turns out there's a trick to it. I've run into this problem twice now, so I figure it should be documented. This is the solution if your "/" route is resulting in "Not Found" or an Apache directory listing.

You can read more about the problem at <a href="http://blog.ardekantur.com/2008/07/phusion-rack-sinatra-and-sub-domains/">Ardekantur's "Phusion, Rack, Sinatra, and sub-domains"</a>, but here's my quick solution:
<br />
1. Disable <strong>mod_autoindex</strong> if it is enabled.
2. Make sure your <strong>RackBaseURI</strong> does not have a trailing slash.
3. Add this <strong>before_filter</strong> to your Sinatra app:
<pre><code lang="ruby">before do
  request.env['PATH_INFO'] = '/' if request.env['PATH_INFO'].empty?
end
</code></pre>

I suppose an alternative solution would be feasible using Rack middleware, but this is what I'm using. Thanks to <a href="http://ryanfunduk.com/">Ryan Funduk</a> for helping me figure this stuff out.
