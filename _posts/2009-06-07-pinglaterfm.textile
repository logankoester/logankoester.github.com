I've spent the last couple of days working hard on a new app for managing your web presence.

There is a service called <a href="http://ping.fm">Ping.fm</a> for broadcasting updates to your blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks all at once, from one place.

This can save you a lot of time if you're trying to manage a brand or keep up with different groups of friends, and it makes it easier to prevent your presence on these sites from becoming stale.

The application I'm calling <a href="http://pinglater.fm">PingLater.fm</a> takes it one step further. Now you can set up pings to be sent at a specified time in the future. You could schedule a product highlight for each day of the month, release new blog posts while you're off on vacation, or whatever else you want to use a service like this for.

It's free for now while I gather feedback and optimize the code, but free users will eventually be limited to 3 pings scheduled at a time.

I have a number of premium features in mind (RSS posting, image/video, iPhone...) to make it a really indispensable toolÂ  for pro bloggers and internet marketing people.

But we'll get to that. For now, I just want to hear from you. Let me know what I can do to make this useful for you!
