Back in 2008 I wrote a Ruby gem for updating your IP address at <a href="http://afraid.org">afraid.org</a>, the free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">Dynamic DNS</a> service. For whatever reason I moved onto other things, and never published the gem. It's pretty basic but serves my needs, and may serve yours, so I've fixed it up and pushed version 0.1.2 today.
